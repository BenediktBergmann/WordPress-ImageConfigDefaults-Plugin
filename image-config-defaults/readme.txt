== Description ==
Auto Anchor is a WordPress plugin. It adds an HTML anchor to every Header-tag (h2-h6) and shows a small chain icon on the side when one is hovering over the anchor. The icon is also a link that contains a direkt link to the specific header.

The style is inspired by the current Microsoft docs ([Example](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/overview-alm#what-is-alm))
